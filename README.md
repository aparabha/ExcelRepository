Documenting an interactive excel dashboard created for a store 
I have created an excel dashboard using dataset from a shop's yearly selling data. Got the data from a youtube resourse. I got a clean dataset and not much of cleaning was needed. In the main  datasheet, only created few new data columns from existing columns using nested if else, text functions. To make the main report dashboard, I have used pivot table, different types of charts, conditional formatting, slicers,format the axis. Insights inferred:1. In month of march most orders are placed, 2. Of those who are mostly adult women (between 30 to 50 age range) 3. 92% orders are delivered. 4. Most buyer are belong to the state Maharashtra. 5.Orders are online mostly from amazon followed by myntra,flipkart etc.

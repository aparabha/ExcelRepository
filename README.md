Documenting an interactive excel dashboard created for a store 
I have created an excel dashboard using dataset from a shop's yearly selling data. Got the data from a youtube resourse. I got a clean dataset and not much of cleaning was needed. Only created few new data columns from existing columns using . Link here - https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping. I have used few formulas like Averageif, nestedif, sumif and xlookup for analysis purpose. Insights inferred:1. Most of the voters shopping habits were not influenced by social media, 2. Of those who have been influenced Instagram has got the highest votes, followed by Facebook. 3. Female genders shopping habits were influenced more compared to the male gender.
